          Bender, you risked your life to save me! Now that the, uh, garbage
          ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual
          inhibitions? Large bet on myself in round one. But I know you in the
          future. I cleaned your poop.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Guess again. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil!
          Ours is small and neutral! I could if you hadn't turned on the light
          and shut off my stereo. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from
          intestinal parasites?
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to be rescued. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the
          insurance money! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!
          Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while
          awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
        </p>
        <p>
          You wouldn't. Ask anyway! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet,
          Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The
          toilet. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. It doesn't look so
          shiny to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Oh, I don't
          have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with
          a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I
          complain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be
          right. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
          Oh yeah, good luck with that. Can I use the gun?
        </p>
        <p>
          We're rescuing ya. No, just a regular mistake. Alright, let's mafia
          things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
          Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with
          the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by
          "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
        </p>
        <p>
          You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? I
          don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all
          the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Guess
          again. Goodbye, cruel world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what
          would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little
          pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… You wouldn't.
          Ask anyway!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because
          I'm involved. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Michelle, I don't
          regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Doomsday device? Ah, now
          the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
        </p>
        <p>
          I had more, but you go ahead. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will
          'destroy' you! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
          This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety.
          You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes
          me feel angry!
