          Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking
          design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad
          design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes
          threatening, the old reassuring.” When you sit down to work, external
          critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do
          great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. The graphic designer’s
          first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the
          format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. You are
          not your fucking work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved
          is fucking good enough. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. When you
          design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s
          not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking
          bother? Don’t fucking lie to yourself. If you fucking give up, you
          will achieve nothing. When you sit down to work, external critics
          aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great
          fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Think about all the fucking
          possibilities. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Never
          let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Paul Rand

          design is fucking brilliant. Must-do is a good fucking master.
          Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Think about all the fucking
          possibilities. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Must-do is a
          good fucking master. Design as if your fucking life depended on it.
          You are not your fucking work. Design is all about fucking
          relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship
          of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Respect your
          fucking craft. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity…
          the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and
          ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking
          possibility of failure. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything
          requires hard fucking work. Never let your guard down by thinking
          you’re fucking good enough. You need to sit down and sketch more
          fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get
          you anywhere. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking
          aimlessly. Respect your fucking craft. Don’t get hung up on things
          that don’t fucking work. Use your fucking hands. Dedicate yourself to
          lifelong fucking learning. Must-do is a good fucking master. Never let
          your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. Remember it’s
          called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment.
